Chespel
=======

Chespel is a high-level programming language (intended for non-programmers too) to design chess AIs.
It abstracts the programmer from the board representation and search techniques,
allowing him to focus on the creative part: board evaluation

Chespel allows...
- new user to create a chess AI in 5 minutes capable of beating average human players.
- expert users to compare and analyze board evaluation techniques
