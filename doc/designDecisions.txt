Design decisions

There is no distinction between integer and floats.
Instead, there is a single type Num which has a fixed precision of 3 decimal digits.
This is because
a) the implementation of numbers is abstracted from the user.
b) it is considered that the user doesn't need more precision.

The textual representation of rows and cols have a $ in front.
This is in order to
a) not 'waste' common variable names a, b, ..., h
b) make parsing easier
