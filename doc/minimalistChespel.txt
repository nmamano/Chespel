Minimaist chespel is a limited subset of Chespel.
This is the first prototype that will be fully implemented and functional,
from parsing to implementing the search.

It is the basis of incremental development: once it is working, additional features will be added incrementally.
A minimalist chespel program is a valid chespel program.

The example minProgram.chp features all the available syntax features.

Specification:

Only has evaluation module, which is implicit (therefore, no module instructions).

Loops are limited to a single loop variable, and the loop variable can't be used implicitly in the loop condition.

There is no support for strings or lists.
There is no justifications.

Does not support direct access to component classes' methods.

The only available operator are ==, !=, abs, and, or, not.
Has very few built-in functions:
	Piece methods: cell, player, type, startingRow.
	Cell methods: row, col, color.
	Row methods: rank
	Player methods: castled, color, totalValue, hasTurn.
	Type methods: value.
The search is a simple, non-optimized minimax.
The board representation is simple and naive, not definitive.

There are no let statements.

It does not handle 'weird placed' spaces, tabs and new lines, nor inline if statements.
